**Core Value: Respect**

> What Respect actually means?
* It is about self-respect as well as respecting other individuals. Each and every member respects individual work by striving for the excellence and providing best results through refactoring.
* It encourages the high value of motivation among the team members because no team member feels unappreciated or ignored.
* This leads to loyalty and the overall goal of the team. 
* This value is very dependent on other values and depends on every member of the team.

> Learning from all the XP core values focusing from Respect Perspective:
* The core values in XP are designed to work with harmony among the team members. 
* Mainly it helps to improve the overall quality of the developed software by embracing the changes with respect to user requirements.
* The second edition of Extreme Programming Explained had added the new value Respect.
* Learning about the respect, it greatly depends on all the 4 core values being followed that leads to developing respect for the peers and always strive for high-quality work from each and every team member.
* All the values are extremely important to perform the tasks efficiently and keeping everything simple. They help to work in teams with synergy.
* Since a software is one entity developed as a whole, the values help all the team members work as one and make their commitment towards the one common goal. Moreover, the overall outcomes become more efficient by maintaining both professional as well as core values of every member.
* During the development, if some mistake is committed by an individual team member, other members help in understanding and overcoming to avoid it in future which points to the important part Pair Programming. This helps create good bonding between the members and everyone values work of each and every team member. This is responsible for developing respect.
* All the above points focus towards the core value of seeing as a whole responsible for looking at bigger picture.


> Week 1(09/23/2017):
* All the group members decided the meeting time by respecting each other's schedule. All other activities throughout the week like Platform selection and exploring the project options were followed considering everyone's opinions.

> Week 2(09/30/2017):
* The week went well. Every team member displayed appropriate dedication towards the development of the skills required and focusing on the base knowledge. I saw synergy in team meetings wherein members respectfully helped each other if any individual faced difficulty in understanding a part of the individual or group task.
* A team member having good knowledge with GitHub helped others who were relatively new to using GitHub which displays the value of respect.
* Team coordination is effortless which is because of all members respecting what everyone has to say and providing feedback based on listening every team member.

> Week 3(10/07/2017):
* The team has started focusing on deciding the final game and its functionalities. Also, the team members have started learning the basics of UML diagrams and its implementation (ie class, sequence and activity diagrams to be made in the present game to be finalized). 
* Everyone respectfully shared their views as to how should members go ahead and think of all the tasks that are to be performed in order to finalize the functionalities. The value was followed by all the members as every member was given the chance to present their points and then weighing out with majority votes to everyone’s agreement in finalizing the tasks for deciding functionalities.
* There was synergy and balance because all the values are being followed appropriately which in turn adds to the respect since this value is dependent on all others.

> Week 4(10/21/2017):
* Each member took 1 game to analyse the feasibility in shortlisting the final game. Figuring out pros and cons for the same, and what all features can be added, each member’s opinions were discussed and the final game decision was made considering all the aspects of feasibility.
* We are now heading to documenting the functional requirements and starting with the initial uml diagrams for the finalized game. The value was followed by team members because each member’s game was thoroughly discussed with all the features and final decision was made.

> Week 5(10/28/2017):
* The Crazy Snake game was finalized in this week and team members performed all the initial tasks like developing uml diagrams and thinking over the various features to be added in the game.
* The team met several times for discussion of developing uml diagrams and start with the initial coding. Each team member respectfully helped others in performing individual as well as group tasks.
* After finalizing, the coding tasks were divided among the team members with mutual understanding and respect. The suggestions of all members were considered in implementation of coding which bought synergy and harmony in performing all the tasks completed this week.
* I could notice the sense of respect among all the members for each individual in the team which is responsible for all the tasks finishing smoothly.
