*Core Value: Simplicity
What actually this value means?
To counter the time-consuming, high risk approach, this value encourages to keep everything simple in the project. It is basically about taking small simple steps to mitigate failures or greater risks. It focuses on this approach : design only what is in the requirements, Anything extra is an unpaid work.
	•	Weekly meetings : Every Saturday
  
  
	•	Summary (09/23/2017) Week #1
	1.	Work is being done exactly as per the tasks for the first week.
	2.	Practice like hands-on-practice had been kept simple by all members to properly understand the basics and avoid the complexities.


	•	Summary (09/30/2017) Week #2
	1.	To gain in-depth knowledge of the Greenfoot , the team decided to study the Greenfoot documentation first.
	2.	The documentation study was kept simple and basic functions of Greenfoot were used to create the game to understand it thoroughly.
	
	
	•	Summary (10/07/2017) Week #3
	1. 	The team studied the UML diagrams and is taking smaller steps by learning basic diagrams to achieve the ultimate goal i.e implementing complex diagrams.
	

	•	Summary (10/21/2017) Week #4
	1.      The team decided the final game by simply writing down pros and cons of each game option.
	2. 	The team divided the modules and started implementing the small modules of the game individually like adding audio to the game.

	•	Summary (10/27/2017) Week #5
	1.	The team started with creating UML diagram like Activity Diagram, Use Case etc so that team can simply understand the flow of the game at later stage.
	2. 	After dividing the modules and creating diagrams, team started implementing the modules of the game like adding actors and their methods.
	
	•	Summary (11/4/2017) Week #6
	1. 	After implementing the actors, the team divided the classes among the members to work upon to reduce complexity.
	2. 	By dividing the classes, the members focussed on the assigned class only to maintain simplicity and used GitHub for integrating the code everytime the changes were made to the class.
	
	•	Summary (11/11/2017) Week #7
	1. 	The team members maintained their assigned individual classes very well and hence less errors were faced by the team because of the way team implemented simplicity.
	
	•	Summary (18/11/2017) Week #8
	1. 	For simplicity, the team finished the basic coding for the game at first. In this week, team implemented design pattern.
	2. 	The way team worked following the core values like simplicty, courage, respect,communication and feedback led the game to finish before time.
