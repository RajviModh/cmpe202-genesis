* Values to track :  feedback
* Weekly meetings : every Saturday 

**What feedback means for us** : We will take every iteration commitment seriously by delivering working software. We demonstrate our software early and often then listen carefully and make any changes needed. We will talk about the project and adapt our process to it, not the other way around.

**Summary (09/23/2017)** 

1. team is taking feedback from some potential users about the game ideas and features which they want to have in it.
2. Team members are continuously taking feedback from each other about how we need to implement the idea and which will be the most effective way to accomplish the goal. From feedback of members, team took decision to use greenfoot 3.0.4 or newer version for the development. 

**Summary (09/30/2017)**

1. Team is taking continuous feedback from potential users and finalizing final features of game.
2. Team is taking continuous feedback from team member about learning methods of greenfoot. Also team is finalizing the features to be implemented.

**Summary (10/07/2017)**

1. After continuous feedbacks, Team found a good defination to work on. Still we are continously taking feedbacks from each other about the functionality to be implemented.
2. Team member are working on different design patterns and giving feedbacks about usability in current raw defination.


**Summary (10/14/2017)**

1) Team is going through implementation style learning and giving feedback about how we can achieve the goal with proper coding style.
2) Team is learning design patterns as individual task and provide feedback to everyone with their knowledge.


**Summary (10/21/2017)**

1) After taking continuous feedbacks, team got the final decision of game. Feedbacks are being taken for final features of game.
2) After learning about various design patterns, team is giving feedbacks about the design patterns to be used in the game.

**Summary (10/28/2017)**

1) After decisidng the final game, team starts taking feedback about the features that must be included for making it more interesting for the user.
2) The team is taking feedbacks from each other about the coding styles and design patterns to be implemented. 


**Summary (11/04/2017)**
1) Team is taking feedback from each other about finalizing design patterns to be implemented in each module.
2) Team is also taking feedback from potential users about the featurs they like the most or they want to change.



**Summary (11/11/2017)**
1) With implementation, team is taking feedback about code integration in each other's modules. 
2) Also team is taking feedback as peer review from each other about written code and how to improve it.

**Summary (11/18/2017)**
1)Team is taking feedbacks about the final implementation and merging of code levels.
2)Team is taking review about which design patterns can be implemented when its possible to have more the one.
3)Team took feedbacks from potential users and added some small features in game.
