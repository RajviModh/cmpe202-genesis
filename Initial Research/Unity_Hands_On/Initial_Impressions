Unity Software Analysis
###########################

1. Installation

•   Installation program is too big. Depending on the various features added, it took 5.8 gbs of space for unity software with 
    visual studio 2017, WEBGL development environment.

•   It supports development environment for multiple platform which can be downloaded while installation from features 
    selection dialog box.

•   If revenue >100K you cannot legally use the free version as per company's terms.
    Downloads the whole program from installer provided by unity.

•   After installation, asks to signup and asks whether using for company or not. 
    Also, makes user select the option whether company you are using for earns >100K or <100K .

•   The pro or plus version asks for serial number and personal version lets you go to survey designed by them.

•   Mandatory survey for location, purpose of use, primary role, your unity skills, expected graduation date, name of institution, 
    its location, institution type, platform of interest and content that user will primarily develop using the tool.
    
2. Exploring the Software

•   Software has inbuilt learn tab to start your learning tutorials based on the different game projects suggested by software 
    which can be downloaded for free.
    
•   Hands on experience is good. Initial impressions suggest that there are many inbuilt tools and components which lets 
    the developer focus on the building game logic rather than worrying for the setting up everything from scratch.

•   Sample project of car game also suggests that most of the components can be used by simple drag and drop inside unity 
    software and there are numerous options by which components can be edited in the inspector panels to the right. 
    
•   The scripting code opens in different window of Microsoft Visual Studio and game implementation opens in unity software.

•   It throws downward compatibility error if user did not install visual studio 2017 edition when any code file is opened
    because of visual studio being community 2015 rather than 2017 community.

•   Installing Community 2017 Studio solves the issue. The example project code has standard assets which explains each and 
    every component like cameras, characters with a text file. It also has the effects, environment and other folders with 
    appropriate code files and comments placed inside code for developers to understand what operation that particular piece 
    of code is performing.
