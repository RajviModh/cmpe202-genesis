Framwork we are going to use:
GreenFoot 
Note : Why greenfoot is attached in separate file. Also go through wiki page.

Reason : 
1) Old and reliable framwork
2) Really huge community
3) Easy to learn as it is using java in coding


Initial Ideas (This can change in our 2nd meeting)
1) Egg and basket
2) Catch the egg
3) Galaxy fighter
4) dx ball 
5) Pool (need to do more research)

Next meeting (Spt 19,2017) Questions: 

1) Do we want to create a game from scratch or going to enhancce an existing one?
2) Which version of greenfoot we are going to use?
3) What are our schedule for everyday Kanban meetings and who is going to maintain the Kanban Board?
