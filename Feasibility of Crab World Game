Feasibility of game Crab World:

In the crab world game, crab has to eat food and stay away from lobsters. Different riding levels can be implemented by in the game
by adding more lobsters in each level.

The team didn’t choose this game because of following points:
•	To increase difficulty level, we need to add more lobsters that is just adding new objects.
•	This game is small for a team of 5 people to develop from scratch. 
•	Also, it was difficult to add multiplayer functionality in the crab world game.
