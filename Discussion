Framwork we are going to use:
GreenFoot 

Reason : 
1) Old and reliable framwork
2) Really huge community
3) Easy to learn as it is using java in coding


Initial Ideas (This can change in our 2nd meeting)
1) Catch the egg
2) Galaxy fighter
3) dx ball 
4) Pool (need to do more research)

Quiestion:

1) Do we want to create a game from scratch or going to enhancce an existing one?
2) Which version of greenfoot we are going to use?
