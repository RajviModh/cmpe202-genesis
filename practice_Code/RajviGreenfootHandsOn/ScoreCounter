//Implementing a Simple Counter In Game



//Storing a reference to the counter in the world.
private Counter theCounter;

public Space()
{
    super(600, 400, 1);
    addObject(new Rocket(), 300, 200);
    theCounter = new Counter();
    addObject(theCounter, 5, 5);
}

//Method added to Space class to retrieve the value of counter.
public Counter getCounter()
{
    return theCounter;
}

//Shot Class
//Accessing the world from the shot, and then calling the getCounter method on the world to obtain a reference to the counter; 
//finally, calling the bumpCount method on the counter reference. So when the shot needs to increment the counter, 
//it asks the world for a reference to the counter, and then modifies the counter using that reference. 

void hitAnAsteroid()
{
    Space spaceWorld = (Space) getWorld();  // get a reference to the world
    Counter counter = spaceWorld.getCounter();  // get a reference to the counter
    counter.bumpCount(5);
}
