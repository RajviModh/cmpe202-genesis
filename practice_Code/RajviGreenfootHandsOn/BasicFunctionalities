//Playing a sound in Greenfoot is extremely simple. Copy the sound file into your scenario's sounds folder. 
//In your code create a GreenfootSound object using the GreenfootSound constructor with the name of the sound file
      GreenfootSound sound=new GreenfootSound ("explosion.wav")
      sound.play();

//The sound can be stopped and paused by using the stop() and pause() methods respectively 
     sound.stop(); 
     sound.pause(); 
     
//The sound can be played in a loop using the playLoop() method 
     sound.playLoop(); 

//Finally, the user can check whether a sound is playing via the isPlaying() method which returns true if the sound is playing and false if not.
     sound.isPlaying();
