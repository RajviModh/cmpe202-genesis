XP core value to be monitored : Communication

Why is communication important in XP ?

It is very common that absence of communication or less communication can cause many problems and software cannot be delivered 
as expected. But if the communication system is well organized, it becomes easier for project partners to understand and act 
on the project.

Summary for week 1:

The team maintains ‘communication’ value by following practices:

Weekly meeting was conducted at the start of the week and everyone being an equal part of the team communicated their ideas 
enthusiastically. We created tasks and divided these tasks among team members.
Also, the team conducted daily face-to-face meetings for 15-20 minutes and communicated completed work and problems if 
any so that others can help.
I feel that these meetings played an active part in the better understanding of the project.

Summary of week 2:

Communication being an important XP value, our team strongly believes in maintaining communication and in 2nd week also,  
team was very enthusiastic in terms of communication.
We had weekly meeting on 23rd September, 2017 and decided tasks for 2nd week. Team members had decided to learn about various 
classes of greenfoot and implement some functionalities which might be useful in game development. So team members met daily and 
communicated daily progress. By these means, team members come to know challenges other team members are facing in learning 
greenfoot and help each other. Also, team stays updated about project progress and workflow was very smooth.
